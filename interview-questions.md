# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JavaScript XML. I think HTML deals with static text.

Researched answer: JSX allows you to include expressions and functions within the syntax, while HTML only allows for static text. JSX is typically used in React applications, while HTML is used to create web pages. JSX elements are transformed into JavaScript function calls, while HTML elements are rendered as DOM nodes.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is what creates an app and can test the code to see if it will pass. This is important for production. package.json and and yarn.lock are modified when ran. 

Researched answer: Yarn is one of the main JavaScript package managers, developed in 2016 by Sebastian McKenzie of Meta (formerly Facebook) for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment. An alternative to the npm package manager, Yarn was created as a collaboration of Facebook (now Meta), Exponent (now Expo.dev), Google, and Tilde (the company behind Ember.js) to solve consistency, security, and performance problems with large codebases.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: Props transmits data to and from various components while state is where data is stored.

Researched answer: Props are used to pass data from one component to another.
The state is local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to other components.
The this.setState property is used to update the state values in the component.

4. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: Div tags are block elements while span tags are inline elements.

Researched answer: Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. However, they serve different functions. A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements, whereas a span element is used for inline organization and styling.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript, even though modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the core JavaScript language.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.

2. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.

3. Ruby: A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
